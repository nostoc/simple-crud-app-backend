## Introduction

This project provides a basic setup for a backend service that handles CRUD operations on a product collection. It uses Node.js and Express for the server, and MongoDB for the database.

## Features

- Create a new product
- Retrieve all products
- Retrieve a single product by ID
- Update a product by ID
- Delete a product by ID

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- MongoDB (you can use a local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nostoc/simple-crud-app-backend.git
   cd simple-crud-app-backend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. The server will run on port 3003 by default. You can test the endpoints using Postman or any API client.
